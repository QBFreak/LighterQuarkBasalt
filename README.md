# Lighter Quark Basalt

A friend of mine was bemoaning the all encompassing blackness when tunneling through a vein of Quark Basalt. I too find it much too dark. While commisterating, it dawned on me, it's easy enough to fix with a resource pack. So here it is. Lighter textures for Quark Basalt.

I had some trouble with ImageMagick and the contrast is a bit ... agressive. But at least you wont be lost in the darkness.

Textures are modified versions of Quark Basalt textures. Credit for original texture design and for the excellent mod Quark to Vazkii.
